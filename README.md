# Advent of Code *PHP implementations by pyrokar*

These are my implementations for the puzzles by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

I try to use all the tools and patterns one would use in a real application
for training and presentation purposes.

## TODO

- [] Complete all Puzzles with TDD (obvious)
- [] GitHub actions
- [] document all algorithms and datastructures
- [] github page for documentation
- [] play with some other tools :-)
  - [] mutation tests
  - [] ...
- [] test with newer php versions
- [] get rid of phpstan baseline :sigh:
